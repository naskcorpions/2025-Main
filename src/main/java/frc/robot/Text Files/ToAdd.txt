Things to add:
    Constants file for certain devices:
        All non swerve motors, or other things on PWM/DIO ports
    Configuration files:
        Files that configure motor controllers
    AptilTag Database:
        Some kind of database thing that has all tha values for locations of targets
        Would be required for auto aim:
            Auto Aim needs tag height, and camera height.
            Some tags are different heights
    Elastic Dashboard Stuff:
        ...
    Add NAVX2 Functionality:
        Check swerve code to ensure it is using the gyro correctly
            Ensure NAVx methods do the exact same thing as the old methods:

        Can also use WPI Dependency Manager?
    Add field odometry:

    Field Oriented Drive:
        1. Get Navx working
        2. Get FOD working
    Install PathPlanner Library:
