In a command file there are usually 5 methods:
    Command method
    initialize
    execute
    isFinished
    end
COMMAND METHODS EXPLAINED:
    Command method:
        Created by:
                public class ExampleCommand extends Command {
                    private final ExampleSubsystem m_subsystem;
                    public ExampleCommand(ExampleSubsystem subsystem) {
                        m_subsystem = subsystem;
                        addRequirements(m_subsystem);
                    }
                }
        What it does:
            It is the command that you call unlike the other methods
            The command schedueler runs the other comands.
    
    initialize:
        Is run by the command Schedueler
        The code in this method should run the required things
        for the command 
    execute:
        Is run by the command Schedueler
        Runs pereodically
    isFinished:
        Is run by the command Schedueler
        Runs pereodically
        Decides if the command is isFinished
    end:
        Is run by the command Schedueler
        If the command is finished, it will run the command in here

Note:
    If you don't need an excecute command, don't put anything in it
    Have isFinished return true
    If you don't need any initilization, or ending, don't put anything in those methods
