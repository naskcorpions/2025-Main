SUBSYSTEMS FOLDER:
    The subsystems:
        Hold code that directly Interfaces the code.
            Ex. Encapsulates hardware control (motor controllers, sensors)
        Handle pereodic Updates
        Can have basic methods in them
        Must extend SubsystemBase

COMMANDS FODLER:
    The commands folder holds all the code that tells the subsystems what to double

RobotContainer.java:
    Creates subsystems
    Configures Controller Bindings


LOGIC PLACEMENT:
    Subsystems → Hardware control, low-level methods (swerve.drive(), elevator.setHeight())
    Commands → High-level behaviors (MoveElevatorCommand)
    RobotContainer → Controller bindings
    Constants → Config values
